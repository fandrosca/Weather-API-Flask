# Weather-API-Flask
#What is flask-weather-app?
A Flask powered weather application.

What do I need to run the application?
Assuming you already have Flask installed, if not go here or if you don't feel like reading just run this command:

pip install -U Flask

Use of virtualenv is encouraged.

You also need an OpenWeatherMap API key. You can get it here.
